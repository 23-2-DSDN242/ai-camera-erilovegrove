## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

# Predator's Eye by Eri Lovegrove
## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 3

### Description
Predator's Eye is a lens that identifies native birds in images using AI and applies a filter. The concept of the filter is an abstract idea of how a native bird might look to the dangers they are subject to, either to predators or climate change. I wanted to convey this idea by making the general image express danger or discomfort, and have the focus be on the native birds. I did this by tinting the image red and inversing the colours, increasing the saturation and creating a pixel effect made of small crosses on the birds as well as overlaying a target on top.

### Process


![Preview 1](preview1.jpg)
When first coming up with ideas I tried using line, circles, rectangels and curves. I found that I went over the maximum amount of parameters. 

![Image 1](preview2.jpg)
I simplified my idea so that I would only be using strokes; simple lines or curves. This was my first iteration, where some letters a still a bit wonky.

![Image 2](preview3.jpg)
I decided to change one of the lines to be more versatile so I could have 2 lines that could act as diagonals. I fixed up letters like K, M, W and U. I changed the colour scheme to convey more of the futuristic style I was going for. I also had to remove a parameter that controlled two small curves for letters like A and 2 image before this one as I thought it looked awful during interpolation. (example below)

(the two small curves/dots at the top of the letter)

My interpolation was also not looking great at the start. Small edits I made was shrinking the two curves down to 0 at 50% during the interpolation so that you wouldn't be able to see the jarring point at which they flip direction. I also made the vertical line shrink in the middle at 50% to add some flair.

Lastly I added 3 little stars to the exhibition mode as I saw that stars were common in Y2k fonts.

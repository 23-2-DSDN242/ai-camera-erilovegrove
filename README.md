## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

# Predator's Eye by Eri Lovegrove
## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 3

### Description
Predator's Eye is a lens that identifies native birds in images using AI and applies a filter. The concept of the filter is an abstract idea of how a native bird might look to the dangers they are subject to, either to predators or climate change. I wanted to convey this idea by making the general image express danger or discomfort, and have the focus be on the native birds. I did this by tinting the image red and inversing the colours, increasing the saturation and creating a pixel effect made of small crosses on the birds as well as overlaying a target on top. 

### Process
![Preview 1](preview1.jpg)\
1. my first bit of code was copied form Phoebe's example code

![Image 1](preview2.jpg)\
2.Here I started experimenting with HSB values

![Image 2](preview3.jpg)\
 3. My initial code for creating 2 layers that I copied from the example code

![Image 3](preview4.jpg)
 4. I created my own shape, a cross so that a cross hatching effect will be applied

![Image 4](preview5.jpg)
 5. Here I inversed the colours and upped the saturation of the bird.

 6. Same thing with a different image

![Image 6](preview7.jpg)
 7. I wanted the background to not be pixelated so the contast between the background and bird would be clearer

![Image 7](preview8.jpg)
 8. I decided to tint the background red to express a more dangerous vibe.

![Image 8](preview9.jpg)
 9. Here I copied another piece of example code to apply an image over the mask

![Image 9](preview10.jpg)
 10. Messing around with my own target and different colours

![Image 10](preview11.jpg)
 11. Decided to make the target white to stand out against the red background
